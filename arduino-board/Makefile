### PROJECT_DIR
### This is the path to where you have created/cloned your project
PROJECT_DIR       = $(shell pwd)

### ARDMK_DIR
### Path to the Arduino-Makefile directory.
ARDMK_DIR         = /usr/share/arduino

### ARDUINO_DIR
### Path to the Arduino application and ressources directory.

### or on Linux: (remove the one you don't want)
ARDUINO_DIR       = /usr/share/arduino

### USER_LIB_PATH
### Path to where the your project's libraries are stored.
USER_LIB_PATH    :=  $(PROJECT_DIR)/lib

### BOARD_TAG
### It must be set to the board you are currently using. (i.e uno, mega2560, etc.)
BOARD_TAG         = uno

### MONITOR_BAUDRATE
### It must be set to Serial baudrate value you are using.
MONITOR_BAUDRATE  = 115200

### AVR_TOOLS_DIR
### Path to the AVR tools directory such as avr-gcc, avr-g++, etc.
### On OS X with `homebrew`:
AVR_TOOLS_DIR     = /usr/local
### or on Linux: (remove the one you don't want)
AVR_TOOLS_DIR     = /usr

### AVRDUDE
### Path to avrdude directory.
### On OS X with `homebrew`:

### AVRDUDE_CONF
### Path to avrdude config file.
#AVRDUDE_CONF      = /etc/avrdude.conf

### CFLAGS_STD
### Set the C standard to be used during compilation. Documentation (https://github.com/WeAreLeka/Arduino-Makefile/blob/std-flags/arduino-mk-vars.md#cflags_std)
CFLAGS_STD        = -std=gnu11

### CXXFLAGS_STD

### CXXFLAGS
### Flags you might want to set for debugging purpose. Comment to stop.
CXXFLAGS         += -pedantic -Wall -Wextra

### MONITOR_PORT
### The port your board is connected to. Using an '*' tries all the ports and finds the right one.
MONITOR_PORT      = /dev/ttyACM*

### CURRENT_DIR
### Do not touch - used for binaries path
CURRENT_DIR       = $(shell basename $(CURDIR))

### OBJDIR
### This is were you put the binaries you just compile using 'make'
OBJDIR            = $(PROJECT_DIR)/bin/$(BOARD_TAG)/$(CURRENT_DIR)

### path to Arduino.mk, inside the ARDMK_DIR, don't touch.
include $(ARDMK_DIR)/Arduino.mk
